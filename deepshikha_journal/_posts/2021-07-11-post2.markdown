This is Post2 content and this has to be unnecessarily long to be able to check how much content comes on blog screen.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name):
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
