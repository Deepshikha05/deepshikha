This is Data Engineering Post 1 content and this has to be unnecessarily long to be able to check how much content comes on blog screen.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name):
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
